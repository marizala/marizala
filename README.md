### Hi, Michael here 👋

- 🧑🏽‍💻 I'm QA Automation Engineer based in Melbourne, Australia 🇦🇺 (born and raised in The Philippines 🇵🇭). I make a living by snatching bugs before they bite, safeguarding your software experience, one line at a time.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently working on expanding my mobile automation knowledge using Maestro.

- 🔭 I’m looking to learn more about Playwright and TypeScript.

- 💬 Ask me about software testing, automation testing or anything QA.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I started my career in software testing during my internship, unaware of its distinct role at the time. It was eye-opening as I thought, all along my uni days, that the only pathway is to become a software developer. I got to see firsthand how software actually gets made, and how crucial testing and quality assurance are in the whole process. Here I am, since 2014, still embracing the thrilling chaos of QA.
